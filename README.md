<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>

</p>

<p>Letâ€™s begin by installing Poetry:</p>

 ```
pip install poetry
 ```

<p>Dowload the repository:</p>

 ```
git clone https://github.com/RafaelNogueiraXD/jarvas-API-Discord.git
 ```

<p>Start the virtual environment with:</p>

 ```
poetry shell
 ```
<p>Now, we can install the project dependencies:</p>
 
 ```
poetry install
 ```
<p>
  Before test the aplicattion , make a ".env" file to create yours enviromment varibles, the content of .env is:
</p>

 ```
BOT_TOKEN = '<your_bot_id>'
APPLICATION_ID = '<your_application_id>'
GENEREAL_CHANNEL_ID = '<id_channel_in_your_server>'
 ```
